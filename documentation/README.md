## Security Improvements v4

### Enhanced Encryption Stack
- **Key Derivation**: Scrypt with strong parameters (N=32768, r=8, p=1)
- **KEM Standard**: ML-KEM-768 as standardized by NIST FIPS 203
- **Secret Key Protection**: AES-256-GCM encryption of ML-KEM secret keys
- **Authentication Tags**: Integrity verification prevents tampering
- **Random Salt & Nonces**: Unique salt and independent 96-bit GCM nonces per user
- **File Permissions**: Restrictive OS-level access control

### Secret Management in Memory

- Password owners use `SecureMemory::SecureString`, which overwrites occupied bytes
  before replacement, logout, and destruction.
- ImGui password buffers are wiped after submission, cancellation, window closure,
  logout, and application shutdown.
- The credential manager no longer caches or displays plaintext passwords after
  verification.
- Archive lists contain metadata only; decrypted payloads remain in one archive
  owner and preview copies are wiped when closed.
- Derived keys, KEM secrets, decrypted serialization buffers, and temporary preview
  buffers are explicitly cleansed on success and error paths.
- Decrypted file bytes are no longer printed in diagnostic logs.

Explicit zeroization reduces the lifetime of recoverable secrets, but it cannot
protect them from an attacker that already controls the running process or operating
system. Copying a secret to the system clipboard also moves it outside the
application's memory-cleanup boundary.

### Security Comparison

| Feature | Version 1.0 | Version 2.0 |
|---------|-------------|-------------|

## 🛡️ Post-Quantum Security

### Simple Usage Guide
PQC Wallet uses quantum-resistant algorithms to protect your data:

1. **Login**: Your password is protected with quantum-safe encryption
2. **File Storage**: Archives use password-derived AES-256-GCM encryption
3. **Data Protection**: All sensitive data is encrypted with multiple layers

### Encryption Algorithms Used

#### Password Protection
```
User Password → Scrypt → AES-256-GCM + ML-KEM-768
```
- **Scrypt**: Key derivation function resistant to hardware attacks
- **AES-256-GCM**: 256-bit authenticated encryption (quantum-vulnerable but still strong)
- **ML-KEM-768**: NIST FIPS 203 post-quantum key encapsulation mechanism

#### Archive Encryption
```
Archive Files → Scrypt → AES-256-GCM → Secure Storage
```
- **Scrypt**: Derives the archive key from the password and a random salt
- **AES-256-GCM**: Encrypts and authenticates archive contents
- **Authentication**: GCM tag detects an incorrect password or modified data

#### Detailed Algorithm Specifications

**ML-KEM-768 (Post-Quantum)**:
- Security Level: 192-bit (equivalent to AES-192)
- Key Size: 2400 bytes (public), 2400 bytes (secret)
- Ciphertext Size: 1088 bytes
- Based on: Module Learning With Errors (M-LWE) problem
- Quantum Resistance: ✅ Proven secure against quantum computers

**Scrypt (Key Derivation)**:
- Parameters: N=32768, r=8, p=1
- Output: 256-bit derived key
- Memory Cost: ~32MB (prevents ASIC attacks)
- Time Cost: Configurable difficulty

**AES-256-GCM (Symmetric)**:
- Key Size: 256 bits
- Block Size: 128 bits
- Authentication: Built-in AEAD (Authenticated Encryption)
- Nonce Size: 96 bits (randomly generated)

### Security Levels

| Component | Classical Security | Quantum Security |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|
| ML-KEM-768 | NIST category 3 | Post-quantum ✅ |
| AES-256 | 256-bit | 128-bit ⚠️ |
| Scrypt | Configurable | Memory-hard ✅ |
| AES-GCM Tag | 128-bit | Authenticated encryption |

**Legend**:
- ✅ = Quantum-resistant
- ⚠️ = Quantum-vulnerable but computationally infeasible

### Why Post-Quantum?

Future quantum computers will break current encryption:
- **RSA**: Vulnerable to Shor's algorithm
- **ECC**: Vulnerable to Shor's algorithm  
- **AES**: Strength halved by Grover's algorithm
- **ML-KEM**: Standardized post-quantum KEM based on Module-LWE

PQC Wallet protects your data today and in the quantum future.
